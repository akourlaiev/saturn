Saturn 1.0

Saturn is a program which allows a sequencing platform to assess the saturation,
to predict the yield of distinct reads from deeper sequencing and to adjust
the sequencing effort even without any reference genome.
Saturn uses an estimation of reads duplication and an equation model estimating
potential errors along with standard saturation.
As sequencing errors introduce new distinct reads and leads to overestimate
the complexity of a readset, we modelize them to predict the correct amount
of new sequences obtained by additionnal sequencing from a library.
